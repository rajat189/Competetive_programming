Output Format:
For each test case print "Yes" if the String "S" is super ascii, else print "No"

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=|S|<=400, S will contains only lower case alphabets ('a'-'z').

Explanation:
In case 1, viz. String "bba" -
The count of character 'b' is 2. Ascii value of 'b' is also 2.
The count of character 'a' is 1. Ascii value of 'a' is also 1.
Hence string "bba" is super ascii.
