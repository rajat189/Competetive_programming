D : Trace the Rats

Given a square maze (A) of dimension N, every entry (Aij) in the maze is either an open cell 'O' or a wall 'X'. A rat can travel to its adjacent locations (left, right, top and bottom), but to reach a cell, it must be open. Given the locations of R rats, can you find out whether all the rats can reach others or not?

Input Format: 
Input will consist of three parts, viz.

1. Size of the maze (N)
2. The maze itself (A = N * N)
3. Number of rats (R)
4. Location of R rats (Xi, Yi)

Note: 
(Xi,Yi) will represents the location of the i-th rat.
Locations are 1-index based.

Output Format: 
Print "Yes" if the rats can reach each other, else print "No"

Constraints:
1<=N<=350
Aij = {'O','X'}
1<=R<=N*N
1<=Xi<=N
1<=Yi<=N
