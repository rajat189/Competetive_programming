Problem : Dictionary

A big data scientist is developing a certain algorithm to make searching easier. To develop this algorithm, the scientist needs a list of all words whose first three characters match in the given input text. You are chosen to assist the scientist. Write a program that processes text and produces matching words. The output criteria and examples will help you in understand what is expected out of your program. 


Input Format: 
Input contains paragraph or text 


Output Format: 
What to print 
 Print all those words, whose first 3 characters match. The order of printing should be same as the order in which they occur in the input. The character matching must be case-insensitive and must be printed in lower case. If the word matches only with itself, omit it from printing. When multiple matching words are found, ensure that they are printed only once. 
Note: - Words may also comprise of numbers. For number case-insensitive matching and lower case printing does not apply. 
Format of printing 
 Let's call all words whose first 3 characters match, a set. 
1.Print one set, per line.
2.Within a set print all words belonging to that set by obeying the following rules ?Print on words delimited by space
?Words should be printed in order of their occurrence in the input
